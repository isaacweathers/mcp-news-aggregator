# Local MCP Server & Agent Architecture: How-To

## Use Case

- **Goal:** Track specific news and information on a chosen topic.
- **Workflow:** Agents fetch, aggregate, and assemble information into logical groupings.
- **Outcome:** Agents feed all information to the MCP server, which generates and updates website content.

## What is an MCP Server?

An **MCP (Multi-Agent Control Plane) server** orchestrates multiple intelligent agents. Think of it as "mission control" for coordinating your AI workers (agents) on complex tasks.

**Locally**, an MCP server is a Python backend (commonly using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)) that:

- Hosts endpoints for agent interaction
- Maintains memory/context (e.g., via vector DBs like [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/), [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), or local SQLite)
- Manages workflows (task assignment, chaining, retries, validations)

---

## Agent Architecture

Each **agent** is a Python program or microservice that:

- Has a specific role (e.g., news fetcher, summarizer, categorizer, writer)
- Communicates with the MCP via HTTP/REST, WebSocket, or function calls
- Can use tools like:
    - Web scraping: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Playwright`
    - Language models: GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, or local LLMs via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
    - Vector search: `faiss`, `chromadb`

## System Components (Local Setup)

### 1. MCP Server

- **Role:** Orchestrates agent workflows and stores agent outputs
- **Stack:** Python (use the version pre-installed in the dev container, e.g., Python 3.10+) + FastAPI + SQLite (or Chroma) + local filesystem
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Register agents
    - Assign tasks
    - Maintain task queue and logs
    - Store memory/context

### 2. Agents

Each agent is a Python microservice or script:

- **Fetcher Agent:** Scrapes or pulls RSS feeds/APIs for the target topic
- **Aggregator Agent:** Cleans, deduplicates, and groups by sub-topic
- **Summarizer Agent:** Uses LLM to create TLDRs
- **Writer Agent:** Generates blog/article-style content
- **Publisher Agent:** Pushes to your local website (e.g., via Markdown to a static site generator like Hugo or Astro)

### 3. Storage

- Use local vector DBs (like Chroma or FAISS) for semantic memory.
- Use SQLite or file-based storage for raw data and structured output.

### 4. Web Frontend

- Static site generator options:
    - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Go-based, very fast)
    - [Astro](https://astro.build/) (great with Markdown + JSX)
    - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (if you prefer React)
- Agents output Markdown or HTML content into a content folder.

## Example Workflow

Suppose your topic is **"decentralized AI"**:

1. **Fetcher Agent** (runs every 6 hours)
     - Pulls articles from Google News, HackerNews, Reddit, Twitter API
     - Sends URLs and content back to MCP

2. **Aggregator Agent**
     - Deduplicates based on similarity
     - Groups articles into sub-topics: "LLMs", "edge computing", "Mistral", etc.

3. **Summarizer Agent**
     - Uses LLM (e.g., GPT-4 via OpenAI API or local Mistral via Ollama)
     - Summarizes each cluster

4. **Writer Agent**
     - Takes summary + context and writes article/blog section
     - Stores to `/content/posts/topic-timestamp.md`

5. **Publisher Agent**
     - Rebuilds static site using `hugo build` or `astro build`
     - Deploys locally (e.g., `localhost:8000`) or syncs to GitHub Pages / Netlify

## Tools to Consider

| Component         | Option #1                | Option #2                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| MCP server        | FastAPI + Chroma        | LangChain server           |
| Agent framework   | Python scripts          | AutoGen / CrewAI           |
| LLM (local)       | Ollama + Mistral        | LM Studio + GPTQ           |
| Memory            | ChromaDB                | Weaviate (optional)        |
| Website generator | Hugo                    | Astro / Next.js            |
| Scheduler         | cron or APScheduler     | Prefect or Airflow         |

## Local Dev Environment

- **Python:** Use the version pre-installed in the dev container (e.g., Python 3.10+)
- **Dependency Management:** Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) (instead of standard pip)
- **Virtual Environments:** Managed by Poetry or venv
- **Serving the MCP API:** Use `uvicorn`
- **Useful Libraries:** `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `openai`, `ollama`, `chromadb`, `jinja2` (for templating)
- **Static Site Folder:** With template Markdown files

### Example: Setting Up with Poetry

```bash
# Install Poetry if not already installed
pipx install poetry

# Create a new project
poetry new mcp-server
cd mcp-server

# Add dependencies
poetry add fastapi uvicorn chromadb requests beautifulsoup4 jinja2

# Activate the environment
poetry shell

# Run the server (example)
uvicorn mcp_server.main:app --reload
```

## AI Model Options

- **Local (fully offline):** Ollama with mistral, llama3, phi
- **Hybrid:** Use OpenAI API for summarization, local for everything else
- **Tool Augmentation:** Give agents access to tools like web search, RSS parsing, and shell commands via AutoGen or LangGraph

## Summary

With this setup, you can orchestrate a local, agent-driven content pipeline using Python, Poetry/pipx, and modern static site generatorsâ€”all within your dev container environment.
